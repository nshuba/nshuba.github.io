In my case, I know that I cannot work efficiently through a laggy VNC conneciton. While I could do most things through SSH and command line, debugging can be problematic.\nA while ago I came across the Visual Studio Code Remote Development\rextension pack. This extension is new, so the documentation for it is not perfect, especially when your target machine is a Mac. I had a hard time finding solutions to the multiple problems I faced when setting this up, so I decided to write it up in a blog post.\nBelow are the steps needed for making VSC debugging work for a C++ project when on a Windows host connecting to a remote Mac. This even works when connecting to a remote VM! I imagine only slight modifications will be needed for other scenarios. The instructions assume you already have a C++ project setup for VSC on your remote machine.\nSetting up Remote Development  Locally, on your host, install VSC and the remote development extension\r. Open VSC, go to File → Preferences → Settings  Search for remote.SSH.showLoginTerminal. Enable this setting. Search for remote.SSH.useLocalServer. Disable this setting.   Now, press F1, search for and select the following: \u0026ldquo;Remote-SSH: Connect to Host\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;  Enter \u0026lt;your_username\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;your_remote_machine_ip\u0026gt; The VSC terminal will prompt for your VM\u0026rsquo;s password    After you enter your password you are connected to your VM and can browse/modify the files there as you would locally! The experience is much smoother than VNC or RDP.\nSetting up Remote Debugging To debug remotely, we will need a few more steps.\n While connected to your VM, we will need to install the following VSC extensions (this will install them on your VM and not your host):  \rC++ extension\r \rCodeLLDB extension\r   Turn on developer mode on your remote machine: $ sudo /usr/sbin/DevToolsSecurity --enable Add the following configuration to the .vscode/launch.json of your project:  {\r\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Launch (Remote)\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;lldb\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;request\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;launch\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;program\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/path/to/your/program\u0026quot; // e.g. ${workspaceFolder}/a.out\r}\r  Go to the debugging tab of VSC, select the \u0026ldquo;Launch (Remote)\u0026rdquo; configuration, and F5 to debug! If you need to attach to a process, use the following configuration to .vscode/launch.json:  {\r\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Attach (Remote)\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;lldb\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;request\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;attach\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;program\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/path/to/your/program\u0026quot;, // e.g. ${workspaceFolder}/a.out\r\u0026quot;pid\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;${command:pickProcess}\u0026quot;\r}\r  Using the \u0026ldquo;Attach (Remote)\u0026quot;, after you press F5 a prompt will open where you can search for the process to attach to.  Hope you found this guide helpful. Happy debugging and stay safe out there!\n","date":1585353600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585353600,"objectID":"73a1b91c494cbd5a48441dfa7ead8c0b","permalink":"/post/vsc-remote-debugging/","publishdate":"2020-03-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/vsc-remote-debugging/","section":"post","summary":"Due to COVID-19, many of us are now working from home and are away from our dev machines.

The ease of app development has led to a plethora of apps that employ poor security practices and often expose personal identifiers to remote servers. Moreover, these privacy exposures often come from third-party libraries that are leveraged by multiple apps, leading to cross-app tracking of users. This tracking is typically used to serve personalized ads, which cost the user extra data and take up screen real estate. In this demo, we will showcase AntWall, a system for preventing exposures of personal information and blocking ads.","tags":null,"title":"Demo: AntWall - A System for Mobile Adblocking and Privacy Exposure Prevention","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anastasia Shuba","Evita Bakopoulou","Athina Markopoulou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525158000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525158000,"objectID":"e6df50c9adc8fa64eca4e4ffecbb1f62","permalink":"/publication/2018_antshield_spawc/","publishdate":"2018-05-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018_antshield_spawc/","section":"publication","summary":"Mobile devices have access to personal, potentially sensitive data, and there is a growing number of mobile apps that have access to it and often transmit this personally identifiable information (PII) over the network. In this paper, we present an approach for detecting such PII “leaks” in network packets going out of the device, by first monitoring network packets on the device itself and then applying classifiers that can predict with high accuracy whether a packet contains a PII leak and of which type. We evaluate the performance of our classifiers using datasets that we collected and analyzed from scratch. We also report preliminary results that show that collaboration among users can further improve classification accuracy, thus motivating crowdsourcing and/or distributed learning of privacy leaks.","tags":null,"title":"Privacy Leak Classification on Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anh Le","Janus Varmarken","Simon Langhoff","Anastasia Shuba","Minas Gjoka","Athina Markopoulou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441090800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441090800,"objectID":"0de40fcba7ea960f3d8416e4b0a022ae","permalink":"/publication/2015_antmonitor_c2bid/","publishdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2015_antmonitor_c2bid/","section":"publication","summary":"Mobile devices play an essential role in the Internet today, and there is an increasing interest in using them as a vantage point for network measurement from the edge.
